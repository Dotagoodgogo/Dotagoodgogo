### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,I am Zhiyuan Gu!

# Introduction

I am **Zhiyuan Gu**, a math-CS major at UCSD, and I am looking for opportunities as a software engineer or game developer. My preferred programming languages are C++ and Python.

These repositories are my individual projects during my undergraduate studies.

Welcome to take a look and leave me your suggestions. You can find my projects [here](https://github.com/Dotagoodgogo).

If you have any group projects related to the fields in my repositories, I would be happy to talk to you about them.

Thank you for your consideration.
